# **End-to-End Data Flow Architecture**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a robust, end-to-end data flow architecture designed to process, transform, and deliver data seamlessly. Utilizing tools such as **Snowflake (AWS)**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Streamlit**, this architecture ensures scalability, data quality, and real-time insights for end-users.

The workflow follows a structured approach, progressing from raw data ingestion to fully processed data visualization, while maintaining high reliability and accessibility.

## **Key Components**

### 1. **Data Sources**
- **API Integration**: Fetches data using HTTP requests from external sources.
- **Marketplace Data**: Retrieves structured data from shared databases.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates hourly data ingestion into the pipeline.

### 2. **Staging (Landing Zone)**
- Stores raw data in its original format (e.g., JSON) within the **Bronze Layer**, ensuring data integrity.
- Acts as the foundation for further processing.

### 3. **Cleaning (Transformation Layer)**
- Data is cleaned, standardized, and flattened in the **Silver Layer**.
- Key processes include:
  - Removing duplicates.
  - Handling missing values.
  - Standardizing formats for consistency.

### 4. **Consumption (Modeling Layer)**
- The **Gold Layer** organizes data into dimensional models (e.g., star schema) for analytical performance.
- Key features:
  - High-quality, analysis-ready datasets.
  - Reliable storage for downstream reporting.

### 5. **Publishing (Business Intelligence)**
- Data is consumed by **Streamlit**, which provides interactive dashboards and reports.
- Ensures actionable insights for stakeholders.

### 6. **End Users**
- Stakeholders access intuitive dashboards or reports, empowering data-driven decisions with minimal technical barriers.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates ingestion through scheduled workflows.
- **Snowflake (AWS)**: Primary data warehouse for storage and transformations.
- **Streamlit**: Lightweight BI layer for visualizing processed data.
- **JSON & SQL**: Data formats and languages used throughout.

## **How It Works**
1. **Ingestion**: GitHub Actions initiates hourly triggers to fetch data from APIs or shared databases.
2. **Storage**: Raw data is stored in the Bronze Layer as JSON files.
3. **Processing**: In the Silver Layer, data is cleaned, transformed, and flattened into query-friendly formats.
4. **Modeling**: Data is structured in the Gold Layer for optimal performance and accessibility.
5. **Visualization**: BI dashboards consume the modeled data to generate reports and interactive visuals for end-users.

## **Setup & Deployment**
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. **Install Dependencies**:
Ensure you have Python and pip installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Configure GitHub Actions**:

Set up workflows in the .github/workflows directory to automate data ingestion.
Add environment variables (e.g., API keys) as secrets in your repository settings.

4. **Deploy to Snowflake**:

Set up your Snowflake environment.
Create the required tables for the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
Load data into the Bronze Layer using Snowflake's loading utilities.

5. **Run BI Dashboard**:
Launch the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash

streamlit run dashboard.py

##**Features**
Automated Workflows: Hourly data updates through GitHub Actions.
Data Integrity: Layered architecture ensures reliable and clean datasets.
