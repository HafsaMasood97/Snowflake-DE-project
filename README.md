##End-to-End Data Flow Architecture

#Overview
This project demonstrates a robust, end-to-end data flow architecture designed to process, transform, and deliver data seamlessly. Utilizing tools such as Snowflake (AWS), GitHub Actions, and Streamlit, this architecture ensures scalability, data quality, and real-time insights for end-users.

The workflow follows a structured approach, progressing from raw data ingestion to fully processed data visualization, while maintaining high reliability and accessibility.

#Key Components
1. Data Sources
API Integration: Fetches data using HTTP requests from external sources.
Marketplace Data: Retrieves structured data from shared databases.
GitHub Actions: Automates hourly data ingestion into the pipeline.

2. Staging (Landing Zone)
Stores raw data in its original format (e.g., JSON) within the Bronze Layer, ensuring data integrity.
Acts as the foundation for further processing.

3. Cleaning (Transformation Layer)
Data is cleaned, standardized, and flattened in the Silver Layer.
Key processes include:
Removing duplicates.
Handling missing values.
Standardizing formats for consistency.

4. Consumption (Modeling Layer)
The Gold Layer organizes data into dimensional models (e.g., star schema) for analytical performance.
Key features:
High-quality, analysis-ready datasets.
Reliable storage for downstream reporting.

5. Publishing (Business Intelligence)
Data is consumed by Streamlit, which provides interactive dashboards and reports.
Ensures actionable insights for stakeholders.

6. End Users
Stakeholders access intuitive dashboards or reports, empowering data-driven decisions with minimal technical barriers.

#Tools & Technologies
GitHub Actions: Automates ingestion through scheduled workflows.
Snowflake (AWS): Primary data warehouse for storage and transformations.
Streamlit: Lightweight BI layer for visualizing processed data.
JSON & SQL: Data formats and languages used throughout.

#How It Works
Ingestion: GitHub Actions initiates hourly triggers to fetch data from APIs or shared databases.
Storage: Raw data is stored in the Bronze Layer as JSON files.
Processing: In the Silver Layer, data is cleaned, transformed, and flattened into query-friendly formats.
Modeling: Data is structured in the Gold Layer for optimal performance and accessibility.
Visualization: BI dashboards consume the modeled data to generate reports and interactive visuals for end-users.
